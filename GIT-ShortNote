GIT---Durgasoft Short Notes:

Topic 2:

-------------------------------------------------
The Basic Terminology of Version Control System:
--------------------------------------------------
Working Directory: where developers are required to create/modify files.
Repository: where we have to store files and metadata and version control is applicable.
Commit: The process of sending files from working directory to the repository.
Checkout: The process of sending files from repository to working directory.
:::::

-------------------------------------
Benefits of Version Control System:
-------------------------------------

1.to maintain different versions and we can choose any version based on client requirement.
2. with every version/commit we can maintain metadata like commit message as who did changes, when he did the change and what changes he did
3. developers can share the code to the peer developers in very easy way.
4. multiple developers can work in collaborative way
5. parallel development.
6. to have access control as who can read code and who can modify code

----------------------------------
Types of Version Control Systems:
----------------------------------
1. Centralized Version Control System
2. De Centralized/Distributed Version Control System

-------------------------------------
Centralized Version Control System:
------------------------------------
This type contains only one central repository and every developer should be connected to that repository.
The total project code will be stored in the central repository and if 4 developers are there but still we have only one repository.

-------------------------------
Problems with Centralized VCSs:
-------------------------------
1. Central Repository is the only place where everything is stored, which causes single point of failure. If something goes wrong to the central repository then recovery is
very difficult.
2. All commit and checkout operations should be performed by connecting to the central repositoty via network. If network outage, then no version control to the developer. i.e in this type, developer work space and remote repository server should be connected always.
3. All commit and checkout operations should be performed by connecting to the central repositoty via network and hence these operations will become slow, which causes performance issues. No local operations and every version control operation should be remote operation.
4. Oranization of central repository is very complex if number of developers and files increases. etc


-------------------------------------
Distributed Version Control Systems:
-------------------------------------
The respository is distributed and every developers workspace contains a local copy of the repository. There is no question of central repository.

----------
Benefits:
----------
1. The checkout and commit operations will be performed locally. Hence performance is more.
2. To perform checkout and commit operations network is not required. Hence if there is any network outage, still version control is applicable.
3. If something goes wrong to any repository there is a chance to recover. There is no question of single point of failure.
4. To perform push and pull operations network must be required, but these operations are not most common operations and we are performing very rarely.




----
GIT:
----
Git is Distributed Version Control System Tool.
GIT is developed by Linus Torvalds(Finnish software engineer), who also developed Linux Kenel.

----------------
Features of GIT:
-----------------
Git is very popular because of the following features:
1. Distributed
Git is developed based on Distributed Version Control System Architecture because of Distributed Architecture it has several advantages:
A) Every Developer has his own local repository. All the operations can be performed locally.Hence local repo and remote repo need not be connected always.
B) All operations will be performed locally, and hence peformance is high when compared with other VCSs. i.e it is very speed
C) Most of operations are local. Hence we can work offline most of the times.
D) There is no single point failure as Every Developer has his own local repository.
E) It enables parellel development & automatic-backups.


2) Staging Area/Index area.
There is logical layer/virtual layer in git between working directory and local repository.
Working Directory => Staging Area => Local Repository
We cannot commit the files of working directory directly. First we have to add to the staging area and then we have to commit.
This staging area is helpful to double check/cross-check our changes before commit and this type of layer is not available in other Version Control Systsem Tools like CVS, SVN etc
Git stores files in repository in some hash form, which saves space and it uses internally snapshot mechanism for this. All these conversions and taking
snapshots of our data will be happened in staging area before commit Eg: If a sample repository takes around 12 GB space in SVN where as in GIT it takes hardly 420 MB.
Hence Staging Area is the most important Strength of GIT.


3) Branching and Merging:
We can create and work on multiple branches simultaneously and all these are branches are isolated from each other. It enables multiple work flows.
We can merge multiple braches into a single brach. We can commit branch wise also.
4) Moving files in GIT is very easy as GIT automatically tracks the moves. Whereas in other VCS we need to create a new file & then delete the old one.
5) Freeware and Open Source
6) It provides support for multiple platforms.


--------------
GIT commands:
-------------
git add: To add files from working directory to staging area.
git commit:To commit changes from staging area to local repository.
git push: To move files from local repository to remote repository.
git clone: To create a new local repository from the remote repository.
git pull :To get updated files from remote repository to local repository.

------------------
Life cycle of GIT:
------------------
very file in GIT is in one of the following states:
1) Untracked:The files which are newly created in working directory and git does not aware of these files are said to be in untracked state.
2) Staged:The files which are added to staging area are said to be in staged state and these files are ready for commit.
3) In Repository/ Committed: Any file which is committed is said to be In Repository/Committed State.
4) Modified: Any file which is already tracked by git, but it is modified in working directory is said to be in Modified State.


---------
COMMANDS:
---------
git init : This command will provide empty repository for our working directory, so that version control is applicable for our workspace. The name of the empty directory is .git, which is hidden directory.
git staus: to check the wheather there are files in the stages area or not.
git add : to add files to staged area
git ls-files: to check files in the staged area
ls : to check files in the working directory.
git log: to check log detail of commit to the local repo.
git commit -m "Both files modified": to commit the files to local repo
git commit -a -m "Both files modified" : to commit the files to local repo


-----------------------------------------
Setting email and user name for the git:
-----------------------------------------
git config --global user.email "durgasoftonline@gmail.com"
git config --global user.name "Durga"


-----------------------------
GIT COMMANDS WITH EXAMPLE 7:
-----------------------------
git init: Initialized empty Git repository in D:/gitprojects/project1/.git/ and .git is an empty repository, which is hidden directory.
git status : to check status of files in all area.
git status -s : to get concise information by using -s option.
git add . :to add all files present in current working directory
git add a.txt :to add one or more specified files
git add *.txt : to use pattern for txt files
git add *.java: to use pattern for java files
git commit -m "commit message" : to commit to local repo
git log : to check log detail

git commit -a -m "commit message" or git commit -am "commit message"
-a means adding files to staging area
-m means commit message


git config:
git config --global user.email "durgasoftonline@gmail.com" : setting email
git config --global user.name "Durga" : setting name
git config --list : To list out all git configurations
git config user.name : To display user name
git config user.email: To display user email
git ls-files: This command will listout all files which are tracked by git.
ls: This command will listout all files present in workspace


------------------
POSTMARTAM OF GIT:
------------------
git log: to see History of all commits in Local Repository.
git log file1.txt :  to see Log Information of a Particular File:
git log --oneline : --oneline Option to get brief Log Information
git log -n 2 
git log -n 2 --oneline 
git log --grep="pattern" : It shows all commits which has given pattern in the commit message.
git log --grep="added" --oneline
git log --since="5 minutes ago"
git log --since="2020-05-17"
git log --until="5 minutes ago"
git log --before="2020-05-17"

TOPIC - 11 Removing Files by using git rm Command
---------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Case-1: To Remove Files from Working Directory and staging Area (git rm)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
git rm file1.txt : If we want to remove a file from working directory and from staging area then we should go for gir rm command.
git rm -r . : It will remove all files

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Case-2: To Remove Files Only from staging Area (git rm --cached)
------------------------------------------------------------------
git rm --cached file4.txt :file4.txt will be removed only from staging area but not from working directory

----------------------------------------------------------------
Case-3: To Remove Files Only from Working Directory (rm Command)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
ls : We can use general linux command rm to remove files from working directory.

:::
1) git rm file1.txt : It will remove file from both working directory and staging area
2) git rm --cached file1.txt : It will remove file only from staging area but not from working directory
3) rm file1.txt : It will remove file only from working directory but not from staging area.
4) ls : to list files in working directory.
5. git ls-files : to list files in the staging area.

-------------------------------------------------
TOPIC: Undo Changes with git Checkout Command
-----------------------------------------------
Checkout command used to discard unstanged changes in the tracked files of working directory:
1) Only for working directory
2) To discard unstaged changes(The changes which are not added to staging area)
3) In the tracked files (The files which are already added to staging area/commit)
4) git checkout is applicable only for the files which are already tracked by git. It is not
applicable for new files.

It is something like undo operation. It will copy contents of the file from index area(staging area) to working directory.
Exampple:
git checkout -- filename


Summary:
git checkout -- file.txt ==> To discard changes in working directory copy.
git checkout => To discard changes in all tracked files of working directory and If we are not passing any argument, then this command will show the list of eligible files
for checkout.
Note: git checkout command can be used in branching also.

---------------------------------------------
TOPIC – 13 Git References (master and HEAD)
--------------------------------------------
git reference are pointer to commit ids and the most recent commit id is master or head
.git/refs directory contains all the referernces that are head,tags and remotes.

git show master -> latest commit
git show master~1 -> commit one less than latest commit //2nd commit
git show master~2 -> commit two less than latest commit //3rd commit


head is reference to master and it is symbolic reference.
Any reference poiting to another reference, it is called symbolic.

For most of the commands (like git log, git diff etc) we have to provide commit id as argument. But remembering commit id is very difficult, even 7 characters also.
Git provides some sample names for these commit ids. We can use these names directly. These are just pointers to commit ids. These sample names are called references or refs.
References are stored in .git/refs directory as text files and there are multiple types of references like heads,tags and remotes.

What is master?
----------------
$ git status
On branch master
1) master is the name of the branch.
2) It is a reference(pointer) to last commit id. Hence where ever we required to use last
commit id, simply we can use reference master.
3) This information is available in .git/refs/heads/master file.

What is HEAD?
-------------
HEAD is a reference to master.
If any reference pointing to another reference, such type of reference is called symbolic
reference. Hence HEAD is symbolic reference.
Bydefault HEAD is always pointing to branch(master).
$ git log --oneline
49aa8d7 (HEAD -> master) both files added
HEAD is stored in root of .git directory but not in .git/refs directory.
$ cat HEAD
ref: refs/heads/master

Detached HEAD:
-------------
Sometimes HEAD is not pointing to the branch name, such type of head is considered as Detached HEAD.

-----------------------------------
TOPIC - 14 --Git reset Command
--------------------------------
There are 2 utilities of git reset command.
Utility-1: To remove changes from staging area
Utility-2: To undo commits at repository level

Utility-1: To remove changes from staging area:
-----------------------------------------------
We can use git reset to remove changes from staging area and it is opposite to git add command.
Example: 
git reset file1.txt  :: to remove changes from the staging area and return to previous state.

-----------------------------
git checkout vs git reset:
--------------------------
git checkout can be used to discard unstaged changes in working directory.
git reset can be used to discard staged changes from staging area.

------------------------------
git rm --cached vs git reset:
------------------------------
git rm --cached file1.txt // The file will be removed completely from staging area.
git reset file1.txt // The file won't be removed from staging area, but reset to previous state(one step back).
ls -> to view files in working directory
git ls-files -> to view files in the staging area.

We modified the content of the file1.txt and added to staging area. But we want to ignore those changes in staging area and in working directory. For
this requirement which commands we required to use?
git reset file1.txt => To ignore changes in staging area
git checkout -- file1.txt => To ignore changes in working directory


Utility-2: To undo Commits at Repository Level:
------------------------------------------------
Syntax:
git reset <mode> <commitid> => It moves the HEAD to the specified commit, and all remaining recent commits will be
removed and mode will decide whether these changes are going t0 remove from staging area and working directory or not.
The allowed values for the mode are:
--mixed
--soft
--hard
--keep
--merge


1) --mixed Mode:
It is the default mode.
To discard commits in the local repository and to discard changes in staging area we should use reset with --mixed option.
It won't touch working directory.

::Example:
git log --oneline
6fcc300 (HEAD -> master) file3.txt added
86d0ca3 file2 added
9165d34 file1 added

To discard commit-3:
git reset --mixed 86d0ca3
git reset --mixed HEAD~1
git reset HEAD~1
Now HEAD pointing to 86d0ca3

----------------------------------
To discard commit-2 and commit-3:
----------------------------------
git log --oneline
59e6cd7 (HEAD -> master) file3 added again
86d0ca3 file2 added
9165d34 file1 added

To discard commit-2 and commit-3:
git reset --mixed 9165d34
git reset --mixed HEAD~2
git reset HEAD~2
$ git log --oneline
9165d34 (HEAD -> master) file1 

Note:
1) It is not possible to remove random commits.
2) --mixed will work only on repository and staging area but not on working directory.
3) whenever we are using --mixed, we can revert the changes, because changes are
available in working directory.


2) reset with --soft Option:
It is exactly same as --mixed option, but changes are available in working directory as well
as in staging area. It won't touch staging area and working directory. As changes already present in staging area, just we have to use commit to revert back.

git log --oneline
1979e61 (HEAD -> master) file3 added again
4d32eb3 file2 added again
9165d34 file1 added

To discard the latest commit:
git reset --soft 4d32eb3
git reset --soft HEAD~1
Now HEAD is pointing to 4d32eb3

git ls-files -> to view staging files 
ls -> to view working directory files

To Revert Changes we have to do Just
------------------------------------
git commit -m "added again"
Use Cases:
1) If some files are missing in the last commit, then add those files and commit again.
2) We forgot to add defect number in commit message.


reset with --hard:
-------------------
It is exactly same as --mixed except that Changes will be removed from everywhere (local
repository,staging area,working directory) and It is more dangerous command and it is destructive command.
It is impossible to revert back and hence while using hard reset we have to take special care

git log --oneline
3d7d370 (HEAD -> master) file3 added again
4d32eb3 file2 added again
9165d34 file1 added

To remove recent two commits permanently:
----------------------------------------
git reset --hard 9165d34
git reset --hard HEAD~2
Now changes will be removed from everywhere.

--mixed vs --soft vs --hard
1. --mixed:
changes will be discarded in local repo and staging area.
It won't touch working directoy.
Working tree won't be clean.
But we can revert with
git add .
git commit
2. --soft
Changes will be discarded only in local repository.
It won't touch staging area and working directory.
Working tree won't be clean.
But we can revert with
git commit
3. --hard
Changes will be discarded everywhere.
Working tree won't be clean.
No way to revert.

Note:
If the commits are confirmed to local repository and to discard those commits we can use
reset command. But if the commits are confirmed to remote repository then not recommended to use
reset command and we have to use revert command.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC - 15 :: Git Aliases – Providing our own Convenient Name to git Commands
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Creating alias Name: We can create alias name by using git config command.
Syntax: git config --global alias.aliasname "original command without git"
Eg: git config --global alias.one "log --oneline"
Using alias Name:
$ git one
bb26af3 (HEAD -> master) two files we added
257073d file1 added

Q2) Create alias Name 's' to the following git Command?
git status
$ git s
git: 's' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.
$ git config --global alias.s "status"
$ git s
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean

Where these aliases will be stored?
All alias names will be stored inside .gitconfig file.
This file will be available in user's home directory.
In the windows it will be available in C:\Users\lenovo
.gitconfig:
[user]
name = Ravi
email = durgasoftonlinetraining@gmail.com
[core]
autocrlf = true
[diff]
tool = p4merge
[difftool "p4merge"]
path = C:\\Program Files\\Perforce\\p4merge.exe
[difftool]
prompt = false
[merge]
tool = p4merge
[mergetool "p4merge"]
path = C:\\Program Files\\Perforce\\p4merge.exe
[mergetool]
prompt = false
[alias]
one = log --oneline
s = status

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC – 16 : Ignoring unwanted Files And Directories by using .gitignore File
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
we have to make .gitignore file and we can add file extension as below to ignore files in commit.
.gitignore:
# Don't track a.txt
a.txt
#Don't track all .txt files
*.txt
#Don't track log files
logs/
#Don't track any hidden file
.*

---------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC – 17: Any Special Treatment For Directories by Git?
---------------------------------------------------------
No special treatement for directories and Git always consider only files but not directories.
Git never give any importance for the directories and Whenever we are adding files from the directory, implicitly directory also will be added.

----------------------------------
Topic-18: Branching And Merging
----------------------------------
Branching:
Whatever files created and whatever commits we did, all these happend in master branch and master branch is the default branch/ main branch in git and generally main source code will be placed in master branch.
A Branch is nothing but an independent flow of development and by using branching concept, we can create multiple work flows.

Various Commands used in branching:
1) git branch -- to view branches
2) git status -- to check status of current branch
3) git branch new1branch -- It will create a new branch: new1branch
4) git checkout new1branch -- Switched to branch 'new1branch'
5) git checkout -b new2branch --- to create branch and switched to a new branch 'new2branch'

Merging of a Branch:
We created a branch to implement some new feature and we did some new changes in that branch, once work completed we have to merge that branch back to parent branch.
First we have to move to master branch by git checkout master
here, we have to use git merge feature --- a branch we want to merge with the master branch.

What is Fast-forward Merge?
After creating child branch, if we are not doing any new commits in the parent branch, then git will perform fast-forward merge. i.e updations(new commits) happened only in
child branch but not in parent branch. In the fast-forward merge, git simply moves parent branch and points to the last commit of the child branch and it does not create any conflicts.

What is Three-Way Merge?
If changes present in both parent and child branches and if we are trying to perform merge operation, then git will do three-way merge.

Merge Conflicts and Resolution Process
In the case of 3-way merge, if the same file updated by both Parent and child branches then may be a chance of merge conflict.
If there is a conflict then GIT stops the merge process and provides conflict message. We have to resolve the conflict manually by editing the file.
Git will markup both branches content in the file to resolve the conflict very easily. Once we completed editing of the file with required final content, then we have to add to
the staging area followed by commit. With that merging process will be completed

How to Delete a Branch?
git branch -d feature -- deleting feature branch.
After deleting the branch, still files and commits are available because the changes are merged to master branch.
git log --oneline --graph  --- graph of commit we commited.

Note:
If we want to combine all commits of feature branch into a single commit and merge that commit to the master branch, then we should go for squash option.
git merge --squash feature

-----------------------------------
Topic-19: Merging By using Rebase
----------------------------------
