Redirection ::
Standard input,Standard output and Standard Error are the data streams and can flow from one place t another.We can redirect these streams as:


1. Redirecting Standard Output:
Standard output Associated with 1
Standard input Associated with 2
Standard Error Associated with 0

but by default Standard output with terminal but we can redirect this standard output from terminal to some where else., it is called output redirection.
We can perform output redirectio  with > and >> .

> ---will perform override of existing data
>> will peform appemding to existig data.


eg: To redirect stnadard output of cat  command from terminal to output.txt.

note: bydefault the standard input redirect to the terminal:
cat
This my first Code



But here we redirect the standard input to the output.txt
$ cat 1>output.txt  /// overrriding the data output.txt by replacing the content from Standard Input.

# cat 1>> output.txt // appending the input stream data to file output.txt file.

$ cat 1 > output.txt // as it is invalid 

:::

bydefault > and >> are always meant for output redirection  only.we are not required to mention as 1 so it can be written as

$ cat > output.txt  // as bydefault meant for outtput rediect so we have not need to mention.
# cat >> output.txt



::Oveeride mode::
$ cat >output.txt
Apple
Bannna
Orange

$ cat output.txt 
Apple
Bannna
Orange

Redirecting Standard Error:::
------------------------------
bydefault standard error device is connected to terminal and we can redirect error messages from terminal to required place.
eg::
$ cal hello
cal: not a valid year hello

As output is redirect to the terminal and if we can redirect to file then as following through error redirection by using > and >> and standard error stream is associated with digit 2.

> --override mode
>> --append mode

$ cal hello 2>> error.txt // error message redirect to error.txt
$ cat error.txt 
cal: not a valid year hello

:::
$ cal hello 2>> error.txt ===> Error redirection with append mode(>>)
$ cal hello >> error.txt ==> output redirection with append mode (>>) as error message will display on error as error redirection is on terminal bydefault.

:::

Redirect Standard Input:
------------------------
bydefault standard input device is conencted with keyword and we can redirect from keyword to somewhere else

Standard Input Stream associated with 0
We can peform input redirection by usin < symbol.

eg:

cat --> bydefautl taking input from keyword.
cat 0< a.txt // getting input from file and output to terminal.

note: by default < is assoctiated with 0 hence we can emit 0 and we can write in short form as:

cat < a.txt // it will take input from a.txt and output Stream is terminal.

If we are not using any symbol with cat command by bydefault it is always consider < only and hence we can remove < also.
$cat a.txt is valid but in system it is as cat 0< a.txt 


//Reading input from a.txt and output to result.txt
$cat 0< a.txt 1> result.txt

$cat a.txt > result.txt // as cat bydefualt has output symbol hene it can emmit and input.


$cat 0<a.txt 1>result.txt 2>>error.txt 
note:
0<a.txt --- input redirection from keyword to a.txt
1>result.txt --> output redirection from termial t result.txt
2>>error.txt --> error redirection from terminal to error.txt

we can write as folling as both are same and one is shortcut

$cat 0<a.txt 1>result.txt 2>>error.txt or
$cat a.txt >result.txt 2>>error.txt 

Suppose both output adn errors redirected to result.txt only.


cat a.txt > result.txt 2>result.txt or cat a.txt &> result.txt both output and error redirection.

>,>> eithet output redirectio or error redirection
&> (override mode), &>>(append mode) ... both output and error redirection to a single place.


Redirecting Standard Output of One terminal to another terminal.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
In Unix every thing is treated as file even as terminal also. so we can find terminal related filr by using tty command.

tty
/dev/pts/0 -> file related to current terminal.

One terminaal --> /dev/pts/0 or check by tty
Second terminal --> /dev/pts/1 or check by tty


ech0 "Hello" > /dev/pts/1 --> directig from current terminal to terminal 1.

Redirection Message between Terminal::
eg:
Teminal 0::
$ tty
/dev/pts/0

$ echo "hello" > /dev/pts/1
$ Hello

$ echo "how are you" > /dev/pts/1
$ fine
$ clear > /dev/pts/1

Terminal 1:
$ tty
/dev/pts/1
$ hello

echo "Hello" > /dev/pts/0
$ how are you
$ echo "fine" > /dev/pts/0



$cal >/dev/pts/1 //showing output to terminal 1

CHATGPT::

Redirection in Unix/Linux

In Unix/Linux, standard streams handle the flow of input and output:

    0 ‚Äì Standard Input (stdin) ‚Äì Usually the keyboard

    1 ‚Äì Standard Output (stdout) ‚Äì Usually the terminal

    2 ‚Äì Standard Error (stderr) ‚Äì Usually the terminal

We can redirect these streams using special symbols.
1Ô∏è‚É£ Redirecting Standard Output

By default, standard output goes to the terminal. You can redirect it elsewhere:

    > ‚Äì Redirect output (overwrite mode)

    >> ‚Äì Redirect output (append mode)

Example:

$ cat > output.txt
This is a test.

This writes to output.txt. Next time if you do:

$ cat >> output.txt
Another line.

It will append instead of overwriting.

üí° You can also use:

$ ls > output.txt        # Standard output redirection (overwrite)
$ ls 1> output.txt       # Same as above; "1" is optional

2Ô∏è‚É£ Redirecting Standard Error

By default, error messages also go to the terminal. You can redirect them like this:

    2> ‚Äì Redirect standard error (overwrite)

    2>> ‚Äì Redirect standard error (append)

Example:

$ cal hello 2> error.txt
$ cat error.txt
cal: not a valid year hello

üîÅ To append errors:

$ cal hello 2>> error.txt

3Ô∏è‚É£ Redirecting Standard Input

The input comes from the keyboard by default, but can be redirected from a file using <:

    < ‚Äì Input redirection

    0< ‚Äì Same as <, specifying file descriptor 0

Example:

$ cat < a.txt           # Takes input from a.txt
$ cat 0< a.txt          # Same as above

Redirect both input and output:

$ cat 0< a.txt 1> result.txt
# or more commonly:
$ cat a.txt > result.txt

Include error redirection:

$ cat a.txt > result.txt 2>> error.txt

4Ô∏è‚É£ Redirect Both Output and Error to the Same File

$ cat a.txt > result.txt 2> result.txt    # Both stdout and stderr to same file (not ideal)
$ cat a.txt &> result.txt                 # Better: redirects both stdout and stderr
$ cat a.txt &>> result.txt                # Append both to same file

5Ô∏è‚É£ Redirect Output Between Terminals

Use the tty command to find terminal file names.

Example:

    Terminal 0: /dev/pts/0

    Terminal 1: /dev/pts/1

$ echo "Hello" > /dev/pts/1     # From Terminal 0 to Terminal 1
$ cal > /dev/pts/1              # Output of cal command sent to Terminal 1

Sure, Rohal! Here‚Äôs a Miscellaneous Examples section to expand your redirection guide with some cool and practical use cases you might not see in basic tutorials.
üß∞ Miscellaneous Redirection Examples
1Ô∏è‚É£ Suppressing Output

You can ignore output by redirecting it to /dev/null, which is like a black hole.

    Suppress standard output:

$ command > /dev/null

    Suppress standard error:

$ command 2> /dev/null

    Suppress both:

$ command > /dev/null 2>&1

üí° 2>&1 means "redirect standard error (2) to where standard output (1) is going".
2Ô∏è‚É£ Logging Both Output and Error to Same File

$ command > log.txt 2>&1

Or shorthand:

$ command &> log.txt

To append both output and error:

$ command &>> log.txt

3Ô∏è‚É£ Combining Input and Output Redirection

$ sort < unsorted.txt > sorted.txt

This takes input from unsorted.txt, sorts it, and writes the result to sorted.txt.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Redirecting with Pipes and Tee

If you want to see the output on the terminal and write it to a file:

$ ls -l | tee output.txt

To append:

$ ls -l | tee -a output.txt

5Ô∏è‚É£ Reading from /dev/stdin or /dev/fd

$ echo "Hello" | cat > /dev/stdin

Or use /dev/fd/0, /dev/fd/1, /dev/fd/2 which represent stdin, stdout, stderr respectively.
6Ô∏è‚É£ Using exec to Redirect for an Entire Script

You can redirect once using exec and every command that follows will use the new redirection:

#!/bin/bash
exec > output.txt 2>&1  # All stdout and stderr now go to output.txt

echo "Starting script..."
ls /notexist              # This error will also be logged
echo "Script completed"

7Ô∏è‚É£ Silent Install with Logging

$ ./install.sh > install.log 2>&1

Installs silently and logs both output and errors for debugging.
