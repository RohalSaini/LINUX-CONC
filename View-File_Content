1. How to view the content of the file :
-----------------------------------------
by following commnads we can view:
1.cat
2. tac
3. rev
4. head
5. tail
6. more
7. less

View content by using cat:
--------------------------
cat < file1.txt where < is optional so cat file1.txt

while display data if we want line numbers, we can use -n
cat -n file1.txt // it shows content with the line number

to skip blank lines we can use -b option with line number
cat -b file1.txt



mix up::
cat -nb file1.txt // leave blank space with numbering but -n useless as the line number already generated by -b

To view multiple files content simultaneously::
------------------------------------------------
cat file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
cat -n file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt

various utilities of cat command:: ( > to create file , >> to append content to file )

1. to create a new file with some content.
cat > file.txt
required data
ctrl+d --> to save data


2. to Append some extra data to an existing file:

cat >> file.txt
required data
ctrl+d --> to save data

3. to view content of file::
cat < file1.txt or cat file1.txt

4. to copy content of one file to anothet file:
cp file1.txt file2.txt // copying content of file1.txt to file2.txt
cat file1.txt > file2.txt // copying data to file2.txt from file1.txt

5. To Append one file content to another:
cat file1.txt >> file2.txt // append data of file1.txt to file2.txt

6. to copy content of multiple files to a single file:
cat a.txt b.txt c.txt d.txt > total.txt 
cat a.txt b.txt c.txt d.txt >> total.txt


cat is the word derived from con"cat"enation

::: MindMap Make:
1. Basic Usage of command
2. Utiltiy of that command
3. Example of that command
4. Miscellaious concepts of that command.


Example:
cat abc.txt // display content of file abc.txt
cat abc.txt > output.txt // send data to output.txt 
cat abc.txt >> output.txt // apend data to output.txt

cat abc.tx xyz a.txt // display multiple content
cat abc.tx xyz a.txt > total.txt// to save contnent multiple data to total.txt

cat abc.tx xyz a.txt >> total.txt// to append contnent multiple data to total.txt

2: tac command to copy data
It is reverse of cat  and it will display file content in reverse order of lines and it is vertical reversal.
tac abc.txt // content display in reversal order with no sorting.
example:

orginal data before tac command.
A
B
C
D
E

tac abc.txt

E
D
C
B
A

3. rev command
rev means reversal and here each line will be reversed and horizontal reverse.

original data:
Rohal
Saini

rev abc.txt
lahor
iniaS



::

cat -> to show file content as it is
tac --> to show in vertical reversal ( from bottom to top)
rev --> to show content in horizontal reversal (from right to,left)


cat display total file content at once and it is suitable for small files .As if the file contains thousand of lines it is not recommended for cat command and for that command we should go for the::

head
tail
more
less




man cat > abc.txt // man page of cat saving inside the abc.txt
ls -l abc.txt /to show content



:::

head commad:
-----------
to view specified number of lines from top of the file

head abc.txt // it will display only 10 lines from top of the file.

if we want 20 or 30 lines.
head -n 15 abc.txt or head -15 abc.txt // display 15 lines from top of the file.
head -5 abc.txt // show 5 lines from top.
head -n -5 abc.txt // it will display all lines from top except last 5 lines from bottom

head -c 100 abc.txt // it will display first 100 characters of the file abc.txt as in linux every character will take one byte .Hence, it will display first 100 bytes data of file content.

head abc.txt // it will display 10 lines from top
head -n 5 abc.txt // it will display 5 lined from top
head -n -5 abc.txt // all content except last 5 lines.
head -c 100 abc.txt // it will display 100 character of or 100 byte data of file abc.txt.

head -c -100 abc.txt // display all character except last 100 bytes of data 



tail comand:
to view file content from bottom of file

tail abc.txt // it will display last 10 lines from bottom.
tail -n 5 abc.txt // it will display last 5 lines
tail -5 abc.txt // it will display last 5 lines only..
tail -n -5 abc.txt // it will display last 5 lines only.

tail -c 100 abc.txt // it will display 100 bytes of content from bottom of file.

tail -n 5 abc.txt tail -5 abc.txt tail -n -5 abc.txt // display last 5 lines.


Question: Assume file contais enough data. Write command data to write from 3rd to 7th line.

Answer: 



head -7 abc.txt // display top 7 lines. (7-3+1= 5)
head -7 abc.txt | tail -5 // display content from 3rd to 7th line.


::
from 15th line to 23rd line: (23-15+1=9)
head -23 abc.txt | tail -9

CHATGPT:

Sure Rohal! If you're preparing for the Red Hat Certified Architect (RHCA) exam and want to do a deep dive on the cat command, here's a detailed breakdown to help you understand it in depth and use it effectively, especially from an enterprise Linux admin perspective.
🔍 Deep Search: cat Command (RHCA Focus)
🔧 What is cat?

The cat command stands for concatenate. It's used to:

    Display contents of files.

    Combine multiple files.

    Create new files.

    Redirect output.

📘 Basic Syntax:

cat [OPTION]... [FILE]...

🔹 Common Use-Cases
Use-Case	Command	Description
View file contents	cat file.txt	Prints the file to stdout.
Create a file	cat > file.txt	Takes input from keyboard until Ctrl+D.
Append to file	cat >> file.txt	Appends to an existing file.
Combine files	cat file1.txt file2.txt > file3.txt	Merges content.
Number lines	cat -n file.txt	Adds line numbers.
Show tabs and line ends	cat -T -E file.txt	Debug formatting.
Suppress blank lines	cat -s file.txt	Removes extra empty lines.
🧠 Key RHCA Tips:
1. Redirection Mastery

    RHCA candidates should understand how cat works with redirection:

    cat /etc/passwd > users.txt

2. Here Documents

    cat is used with HereDocs in shell scripting:

    cat <<EOF > myfile.txt
    This is a test
    Written with a here doc
    EOF

3. Binary Files Warning

    Don’t use cat with binary files like /bin/ls. It'll print junk or hang the terminal.

    cat /bin/ls   # ⚠️ Avoid!

4. Piping & Filtering

    Combine with tools like grep, awk, less, head, etc.:

    cat file.txt | grep "error"

    ✅ RHCA Tip: While cat is simple, RHCA expects you to know when to avoid unnecessary usage. Example: cat file | grep something is better written as grep something file.

⚠️ Best Practices & Misuse

    ✅ Good: cat file.txt

    ❌ Bad: cat file.txt | less → better: less file.txt

    ❌ Bad: cat file | grep → better: grep pattern file

🧪 Advanced Examples for Practice
➤ 1. Split File Lines Across Columns (simulate)

cat file1.txt file2.txt | paste -d "\t" - -

➤ 2. Generate a Log with Timestamp

cat <<EOF >> log.txt
[$(date)] Deployment successful.
EOF

➤ 3. Compare Files Using cat + diff

cat file1.txt > tmpfile && diff tmpfile file2.txt

🔄 Alternatives to cat in RHCA Context
Tool	When to Use
less, more	For viewing large files.
tail, head	For reading specific lines.
tac	To reverse file lines.
awk, sed	For structured parsing and editing.
📚 Man Page Excerpt

man cat

Key options:

    -A: Show all, including non-printing characters.

    -E: Show $ at end of each line.

    -n: Number lines.

    -T: Show tab characters as ^I.

✅ RHCA Real-World Example:

# Automate a log merge
cat /var/log/httpd/access.log /var/log/httpd/error.log > /tmp/combined_httpd.log

Would you like me to create a cheat sheet, real-world case scenario, or shell script for cat usage relevant to system administration or RHCA practice?

Sure Rohal! Here's a list of miscellaneous and clever usages of the cat command that are great for competitive tests, sysadmin interviews, and Linux certifications like RHCSA/RHCE/RHCA. These go beyond the basics and show how cat can be used in practical, time-saving, or tricky ways:
🛠️ Miscellaneous cat Usages for Competitive Tests
🔹 1. Create a File with Multiple Lines

cat > info.txt <<EOF
Name: Rohal Kumar
Role: Sysadmin
Domain: geeksquad.local
EOF

✅ Creates info.txt with multi-line content using a here-document.
🔹 2. Merge Multiple Files into One

cat file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt > combined.txt

✅ Useful for backing up or aggregating logs, configs, etc.
🔹 3. Number All Lines (Like nl)

cat -n file.txt

✅ Adds line numbers, even for empty lines — often asked in tests.
🔹 4. Suppress Repeated Empty Lines

cat -s notes.txt

✅ Removes extra blank lines — great for cleaning up content quickly.
🔹 5. Make an Executable Script with cat

cat > hello.sh <<EOF
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, world!"
EOF
chmod +x hello.sh

✅ Dynamically write and run scripts — great for scripting rounds in exams.
🔹 6. Display Non-Printable Characters

cat -v file.txt

✅ Helps in detecting hidden/newline characters or carriage returns (^M) in config files.
🔹 7. Combine with Pipes

cat file.txt | grep "error" | sort | uniq

✅ Chain filtering, sorting, and deduplication — shows command-line fluency.
🔹 8. Compare Two Files Side-by-Side

cat file1.txt file2.txt | pr -m -t

✅ Display both file contents in columns for comparison.
🔹 9. Use in Cron Job Logs

cat /tmp/cronlog.txt >> /var/log/cronjobs.log

✅ Append periodic logs to a central log file.
🔹 10. Inspect Special Device Files

cat /dev/null        # returns nothing (used to clear files)
cat /dev/urandom     # dumps random binary data (⚠️ ctrl + c to stop)

✅ Often appears in tricky multiple-choice questions.
🔹 11. Create Config Files Quickly

cat > /etc/myapp.conf <<EOF
PORT=8080
LOG=enabled
SECURE=true
EOF

✅ Efficient way to generate configuration files for exams or labs.
🔹 12. Read Output of a Command into a File

cat <<EOF > backup_report.txt
Backup Report - $(date)
==========================
$(df -h)
$(uptime)
EOF

✅ Combines cat with command substitution for reporting or logging.
🔹 13. Dump a Binary File to Hex (with xxd)

cat file.png | xxd | less

✅ Used in security or forensic-related tasks — a favorite in RHCA-level tests.
🔹 14. Duplicate File Content

cat file.txt | tee copy1.txt copy2.txt > /dev/null

✅ Copies input to multiple files at once (cool shell trick).
🔹 15. Monitor a File That Keeps Growing

watch -n 2 "cat /var/log/messages | tail -n 10"

✅ Like tail -f but useful when cat is the only allowed command in challenges.
