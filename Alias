Command Aliasing:
-----------------

Alias means alternative name or nick name
We can give our own more convinient nicknames for unix commands. This cncept is called command aliasing.

How to create alias name:
$ alias nickname="orginical command"
$ alias nickname='original command'
$ alias nickname=original command

While defining name before and after equal symbol space is not allowed.

$ alias nickname ='original command' // not allowed
$ alias nickname = 'original command' // not allowed
$ alias nickname= 'original command' // not allowed

You can check alias as alias command.

Our own alias:
--------------
alias cls='clear' now cls will work ans you can check in alias its added in the alias and we can check.


Remove alias::
--------------
We have to use unalias command.
$unalias cls

to remove all alias we can:
$unalias -a

to check wheather alias is given:
$ type cls
cls is aliased to `clear'


renaming alias as it override the cls name with new command.
alias cls=clear
alias cls=date


We can create the alias of own created alias as well:
alias cls=clear
alias allClear=cls

allClear --> it will clear screen.


:::
Where we use aliasing:
1. if any lenghty command repeatedly then , we can create shorcit name and we can use shortcut evertime.

mkdir dir1;touch dir1/file{1..20}.txt

alias s20f="mkdir dir1;touch dir1/file{1..20}.txt"
s20f => 20 files created with dir1


 eg: To listout all files present in current working directory , save this data to output.txt and display the number of lies to the terminal.Define alias for curretn for this activity?
Anser:
alias current="ls |tee output.txt|wc -l
current


2. To use our home operating system commands in linux directly 
alias cls=clear
alias rename=mv

3. to handle types mistakes
alias grpe=grep

4. to handle language barriers:
in germany ==> datum
alias datum=date


how to persist alias permanently ?
----------------------------------

by using 2 ways 
1. .bashrc file inside user home directory.

ls -a --tosee hidden files.
inside .bashrc own aliases but recomended to added at last

# my own aliases
alias cls=clear
alias ddd=date date date

to refect these alias we have to restart terminal


2. instead of editing .bashrc file , we can create our own file to defined own alias in home directory
the name of the file should be .bash_aliases
# my own aliases
alias cls=clear
alias ddd=date date date



Queston: What is the purpose of alias command ?
to define alias
to list out all aliases

How to use unalias command ?
unalias -a

to persist aliases , in which file we have to define ?
.bashrc or .bash_aliases

which is the valid way to crate aliases ?
alias rename=mv
alias rename="mv"
alias rename='mv'

Your notes on Command Aliasing in Unix/Linux are pretty solid! I've gone ahead and cleaned up the grammar, formatting, and clarity a bit so you can use this as a reference or share it if needed. Here's the refined version:
Command Aliasing in Unix/Linux
What is Alias?

An alias is an alternative or nickname for a command. Aliasing allows users to create convenient shorthand versions of longer or frequently used commands.
How to Create an Alias

Syntax:

alias nickname="original command"
alias nickname='original command'
alias nickname=original_command

    ❗ No spaces are allowed before or after the equal sign.

❌ Invalid examples:

alias nickname ='command'
alias nickname = 'command'
alias nickname= 'command'

View Existing Aliases

Use the alias command to list all currently defined aliases:

alias

Example: Creating and Using an Alias

alias cls='clear'

Now typing cls will work the same as clear.

To check how a command is aliased:

type cls

Output:

cls is aliased to `clear`

Overriding an Alias

alias cls='clear'
alias cls='date'

The second alias will override the first one. Now cls runs the date command.
Creating an Alias of Another Alias

alias cls='clear'
alias allClear='cls'

Now typing allClear will also clear the screen.
Where is Aliasing Useful?

    Shortcuts for Long Commands

alias s20f="mkdir dir1; touch dir1/file{1..20}.txt"
# Typing s20f will create a folder and 20 files.

Combining Multiple Commands Example: List all files, save to output.txt, and display the line count.

alias current="ls | tee output.txt | wc -l"
current

Use Familiar Commands from Other OS

alias cls='clear'
alias rename='mv'

Correcting Typos

alias grpe='grep'

Handling Language Barriers

    alias datum='date'   # 'datum' is German for 'date'

Removing Aliases

To remove a specific alias:

unalias cls

To remove all aliases:

unalias -a

Making Aliases Persistent

To keep aliases available even after restarting the terminal:
Option 1: Add to .bashrc

    Open .bashrc in your home directory.

nano ~/.bashrc

Add your aliases at the end:

# My own aliases
alias cls='clear'
alias ddd='date; date; date'

Save and exit, then restart the terminal or run:

    source ~/.bashrc

Option 2: Create .bash_aliases File

    Create and open .bash_aliases in your home directory:

nano ~/.bash_aliases

Add your aliases:

alias cls='clear'
alias ddd='date; date; date'

Ensure your .bashrc contains the following line to load .bash_aliases:

    if [ -f ~/.bash_aliases ]; then
        . ~/.bash_aliases
    fi

Quick Questions & Answers

    To remove one alias: unalias name

    To remove all aliases: unalias -a

Q: Where to persist aliases?
A: In .bashrc or .bash_aliases file in the home directory.

Q: Which of the following are valid alias definitions?
✅ Valid:

alias rename=mv

RHCA - Command Aliasing in Unix/Linux
Problem 1: Multiple Command Execution via Alias
You need to define an alias 'cleanlog' that clears the contents of /var/log/messages, then lists the updated
size.
Alias:
alias cleanlog='> /var/log/messages && ls -lh /var/log/messages'
Note: In scripts, use 'shopt -s expand_aliases' to allow alias expansion.
Problem 2: Alias for Root-Only Command
Alias 'upd' should run 'yum update -y' only if user is root.
Alias:
alias upd='[ $(id -u) -eq 0 ] && yum update -y || echo "Run as root!"'
Problem 3: Alias That Accepts Arguments
Aliases can't accept arguments. Use functions instead.
Function:
glog() {
git log --oneline "$@"
}
Problem 4: Persistent Aliases Check
Ensure .bashrc contains:
if [ -f ~/.bash_aliases ]; then
. ~/.bash_aliases
fi
Page 1
RHCA - Command Aliasing in Unix/Linux
Then source it using:
source ~/.bashrc
Problem 5: Conflict Between Shell Keyword and Alias
'test' is a shell builtin. Alias will not override it.
Use a different name like 'mytest'.
Check type using: type test
Problem 6: Auto-Switch to Directory and Run Script
Alias to switch directory and run a script:
alias godev='cd ~/projects/dev && ./start.sh'
Problem 7: Language Compatibility
Alias for German users:
alias speicher='df -h'
Problem 8: Create a Nested Alias Tree
Define:
alias cls='clear'
alias allclear='cls && echo "Screen cleared!"'
Note: Works only in interactive shells
