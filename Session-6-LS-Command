1. ls command
lisy ou all files and directry present in the given directory. and if we are not prividing any directory then it will list out present working directroy.

$ ls dire -> list out dire directory
$ ls --> list out present working directory as we have not provide any directory.
$ man command => to provide man complete documentation page related to comand.
$ man ls -> man ls documnetation.
$ man ls >ls_doc.txt ->save output to the file ls.txt.




Various optios for ls commands:
--------------------------------

1. ls
list out files and directory present in current working directory in alphabetical order.
2. ls -r -> to list out names in reverse of alphabetical order.
3.ls -l -> to display in long listing form or complete desciption.
Example:
rohal@rohal-Latitude-5501:~$ ls -l

-rw-rw-r-- 1 rohal rohal  1452 Apr 16 01:18  file1.txt

-rw-rwr--
First Charcter(-) --- type of file
(rw-rw-r--)Remaining 9 charcter are permission.

1 -> number of link files
rohal -> user or owner name
rohal -> user/owner name.
1452 -> size of file.
Apr 16 01:18 -> creation date
file1.txt -> filename.


4. ls -t => to creation or last modified time & most resent will be at top and old one will be at bottom.

5. ls -lt -> most modified at top with long lasting.
6. ls -ltr -> old one at top due to reverse order for ltr is not important. 
7. ls -l -t -r 
8. ls -a -> all files including hidden files.
9. ls -A -> all bur except . & .. and remaning things will displayed.
example:
ls | wc -l => 10
ls -a| wc -l => 27
ls -A| wc -l => 25


10. ls -F /bin=> to display file by type(link file,directory file)

/ -> directory
* -> executable file
@ -> link file


11. ls -f -> list out all file including hidden files but without color convention.

12. ls -i -> to display al file including inode number
 inode -> index node inludes attributed related to file.
 i-node is the address of loction where file attributes are stored inlcudes;
 a. size
 b. no if link file
 c. creation time
 d. modfiied time
 e. group name
 f. owner name
$ls -ltri


13 ls -R -> means Recrusive

:::
he ls command is used to list all files and directories in a given directory.
If no directory is provided, it will list the contents of the present working directory.
Examples:

$ ls dire       # Lists contents of the 'dire' directory
$ ls            # Lists contents of the current directory

📖 man Command

Used to open the manual page (documentation) of a command.

$ man ls              # Displays the manual for 'ls'
$ man ls > ls_doc.txt # Saves the manual content into a file named ls_doc.txt

📌 Various Options for ls Command:
1. ls

    Lists files and directories in alphabetical order (default).

2. ls -r

    Lists contents in reverse alphabetical order.

    1 → Number of hard links

    rohal → Owner name

    rohal → Group name

    1452 → File size in bytes

    Apr 16 01:18 → Last modified date/time

    file1.txt → File name

    Sort by modification time, newest files first.

5. ls -lt

    Long listing sorted by time (newest first).

6. ls -ltr

    Long listing sorted by time, but in reverse (oldest files first).

7. ls -l -t -r

    Equivalent to ls -ltr

🔍 Hidden Files and More:
8. ls -a

    Shows all files, including hidden files (starting with .)

9. ls -A

    Same as -a but excludes . and ..

ls | wc -l      # Count regular files
ls -a | wc -l   # Count all files including hidden
ls -A | wc -l   # Count all except . and ..

📌 Additional Options:
10. ls -F

    Appends a symbol to each item:

        / for directories

        * for executables

        @ for symbolic links

ls -F /bin

11. ls -f

    Lists all files (including hidden), without sorting or color formatting.

12. ls -i

    Shows inode numbers with each file.
    Inodes store metadata like:

        File size

        Number of links

        Owner, group

        Creation/modification time

ls -ai

13. ls -R

    Recursive listing – shows contents of subdirectories as well.

14. ls -s

    Shows the size of each file in blocks (usually 1 block = 1 KB or 4 KB).

15. ls -h

    Human-readable file sizes (e.g., 1K, 1M, 1G).

🧾 Viewing Large Output

ls -l | head           # Shows first 10 entries
ls -l | head -20       # Shows first 20 entries
ls -l | tail           # Shows last 10 entries

ls -l /etc | more      # Page by page forward
ls -l /etc | less      # Scroll forward and backward

🧠 Quick Notes:

    All files including hidden with inode numbers:

ls -ai

Long listing of all files including hidden ones, sorted by oldest:

    ls -arlt

    ls -r: Reverse alphabetical

    ls -rt: Reverse by modification date

🕶️ Hidden Files Example:

.abc
.bashrc

Extra


ls is one of the most frequently used commands in Linux. It allows users to list directory contents, and with various options (flags), you can customize the output to get everything from hidden files to human-readable sizes and recursive listings.
🔹 Basic Usage
🔸 Syntax:

ls [options] [directory]

    If no directory is specified, ls will act on the current working directory.

    If you specify a directory, ls will list its contents instead.

🔹 Manual Documentation
man Command:

The man command shows the manual (documentation) for any Linux command.

man ls         # Opens the manual page for ls
man ls > ls.txt  # Saves the manual to a text file

🔹 Detailed Explanation of ls Options
1. ls

Lists files and directories in the current working directory in alphabetical order.

$ ls
Documents  Downloads  file.txt  script.sh

2. ls -l → Long Listing Format

Displays detailed information for each file/directory.

$ ls -l
-rw-r--r-- 1 rohal rohal 1234 Apr 21 12:00 file.txt

Breakdown of Each Field:
Field	Description
-rw-r--r--	File permissions: type and access for owner, group, others
1	Number of hard links to the file
rohal	Owner of the file
rohal	Group owner of the file
1234	Size of the file in bytes
Apr 21 12:00	Last modified date and time
file.txt	File name
File Type Characters:

    - → Regular file

    d → Directory

    l → Symbolic link

    c → Character device file

    b → Block device file

3. ls -a → All Files (Including Hidden)

Hidden files start with a dot .. This flag lists everything, including . (current dir) and .. (parent dir).

$ ls -a
.  ..  .bashrc  .profile  file.txt

4. ls -A → Almost All

Like -a, but excludes . and ...

$ ls -A
.bashrc  .profile  file.txt

5. ls -r → Reverse Order

Lists files in reverse alphabetical or reverse time if combined with -t.
6. ls -t → Sort by Modification Time

Lists newest files first, useful for checking recent activity.

$ ls -lt

7. ls -ltr → Long Listing, Time Sorted, Reverse

Lists files from oldest to newest, with full details.

$ ls -ltr

8. ls -F → Show File Types with Symbols

Adds a symbol to help you recognize file types:

    / for directory

    * for executable

    @ for symbolic link

    = for socket

    | for FIFO

$ ls -F
bin/  run.sh*  README.txt

9. ls -f → No Sorting

Lists files as-is, without any formatting or sorting. Also includes hidden files.
10. ls -i → Inode Numbers

Shows the inode number for each file.
An inode is a data structure storing metadata (excluding filename).

$ ls -i
1234567 file.txt

What's in an inode:

    File size

    Owner and group

    Permissions

    Timestamps (creation, modification)

    Number of hard links

    Data block locations

11. ls -s → Block Size Used

Shows size in blocks used by each file. Often used with -h.
12. ls -h → Human-Readable Sizes

Shows file sizes in KB, MB, GB rather than bytes.

$ ls -lh
-rw-r--r-- 1 rohal rohal 1.5K Apr 21 12:00 file.txt

13. ls -R → Recursive Listing

Lists contents of all subdirectories, recursively.

$ ls -R

14. Combine Options:

You can combine multiple options together:

ls -alh     # Show all files with long listing and human-readable size
ls -ltrh    # Long listing, reverse time, human-readable

🔹 Paging Output

When output is long, use paging tools:

ls -l /etc | more     # View one page at a time
ls -l /etc | less     # View and scroll both directions

🔹 Filtering and Counting
Count files:

ls | wc -l          # Count visible files
ls -a | wc -l       # Count all files including hidden
ls -A | wc -l       # Count all except . and ..

🔹 Hidden File Examples

.bashrc
.gitconfig
.profile

Hidden files are often used to store user preferences, config files, or version control metadata.
🔹 Practical Tips

✅ Use ls -lh to get a quick view of file sizes
✅ Use ls -ltr when reviewing logs or backup folders
✅ Use ls -a to debug if a config file is missing
✅ Use ls -i for troubleshooting filesystem or inode issues
✅ Use ls -RF for a complete directory tree and file type view
