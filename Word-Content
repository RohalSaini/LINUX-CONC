📘 RHCA/RHCSA – Detailed Notes
🔧 Topic: wc – Word Count Command in Linux
📌 Description:

The wc (word count) command is used to count lines, words, characters, bytes, and the length of the longest line in a file or files.
🔹 Syntax:

wc [options] [filename...]

🛠️ Common Options:
Option	Description
-l	Count the number of lines
-w	Count the number of words
-c	Count the number of bytes (characters)
-L	Show length of the longest line
-m	Count characters (instead of bytes)
-lw	Count lines and words
-lc	Count lines and characters
-wc	Count words and characters

    💡 -m is similar to -c unless you are dealing with multi-byte characters (UTF-8 etc.).

📂 Example File (abc.txt):

Let's say this file has:

That’s:

    4 lines

    24 words
